# Application Story and Description
,,,
Well I was able to understand certain important elements in this assignmeent such as the use of bootstrap components like the navbar and the form on the contact page. However, I recognized through this assignment that CSS is something I need to practice and work on. I struggled to get a lot of the layout stuff figured out like the colors on the navbar though I eventually did solve that one. The portfolio page is probably the weakest designed page yet its functional and I'm happy I at least got that working. I aso could not get the text to wrap how I wanted it to on the about me page but I was happy to figure out how to get my image in there. I'm also happy that it seems to function as it should. I know with more time I could figure out my problems and I'm happy it got the portfolio to be responsive to different screens. The container and row and column tags were really the key to this assignment. As well as figuring out bootstraps css and semantic tags like the card and card body tags helped a lot.
